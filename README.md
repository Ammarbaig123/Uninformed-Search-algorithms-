# Uninformed-Search-algorithms-
# Breadth-first search
It is the most common search strategy for traversing a tree or graph. This algorithm searches breadthwise in a tree or graph, so it is called breadth-first search.
# Depth-first Search
Depth-first search isa recursive algorithm for traversing a tree or graph data structure.
It is called the depth-first search because it starts from the root node and follows each path to its greatest depth node before moving to the next path.
DFS uses a stack data structure for its implementation.
